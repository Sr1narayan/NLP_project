# Project
Overview
The WhatsApp Chat-data Analysis tool allows users to comprehensively analyze their WhatsApp chat data. It utilizes advanced algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and data visualization to extract valuable insights from the chat data.
Features
Advanced NLP Analysis: The tool applies tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, sentiment analysis, and text classification to analyze the chat data thoroughly.
Valuable Insights: Extracts insights on message frequency, word usage, sentiment, and emoji patterns, providing meaningful information about communication patterns and trends.
Interactive Visualizations: Generates interactive visualizations using popular libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas, enabling users to visualize the chat data through graphs and charts for better understanding and analysis.
Introduction
Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 1.5 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide.

I thought of various projects on which I could analyse data like - Air Quality Index or The cliched Covid-19 Data Analysis.

But I thought why not do Data Analysis on a WhatsApp group chat of college students and find out interesting insights about who is most active, who are ghosts (the ones who do not reply), my sleep schedule, the most used emoji, the most actives times of the day, or does the group use phones during college teaching hours?

These would be some interesting insights for sure, more for me than for you, since the people in this chat are people I know personally.
